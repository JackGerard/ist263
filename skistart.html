        <h1>Welcome to Ski for All</h1>
Ski for All is a community initiative dedicated to making skiing accessible for everyoneâ€”no matter their background or experience. By partnering with local schools, Boys & Girls Clubs, ski shops, and mountains, we help kids discover the joy of winter sports through affordable lessons, donated gear, and inclusive programs. Our mission is simple: open the slopes to everyone and inspire a lifelong love for the mountain.
