        <h1>Jack Gerard Bio</h1>
        Hi, my name is Jack Gerard. I am a senior studying data analytics, and I am interested in examining statistics related to sports. I enjoy skiing, skateboarding, and playing Mario Kart. I am a big fan of all of The Hobbit and The lord of the Rings movies. Battle of the Five Armies and Return of the King are my 2 favorites. I have a mom, dad, sister, and a dog named Montana.
