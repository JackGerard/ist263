                Few things in life compare to the exhilarating feeling of carving down a mountain piercing through the wind
                floating on powder. No matter how good the snow is, skiing and snowboarding as a whole are so much more than
                just sports — they are about adventure, rush, community, and pure fun.

            <h2 id="story">My Story</h2>

            <p>
                I first started skiing when I was around 5 years old at Jiminy Peak. I would go with all my aunt, uncles and cousins.
                Some of my favorite childhood memories were made there. The excitement of those first few trips sparked the passion
                that still drives me today.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I grew older I started snowboarding to add a new aspect of the adventure. Finding a new rhythm and experiencing
                the mountain in a way I never had before. Now I tend to switch between depending on the conditions.
            </p>

            <h2 id="why">Why should you try it</h2>

            <p>Adventure and freedom — every run is a path through beautiful scenery.</p>
            <p>Health and fitness — keeps you in shape and is a fun way to build endurance.</p>
            <p>Community — the mountain brings people together, you’ll have some of the best conversations on the chairlift with strangers.</p>
